Hi Nick,

I am Nidhi, full stack developer of cloud 9 team working from home in India. Currently I am using Cloud Pc which is having 128 Gb Space. Even though I am having official software only still I have 24Mbs as Free memory. I am facing this issue for a while now. Because of this I am not able to work properly and not able to clone repos which I need to work on, my task is gets delay. That is why I would like to request you to give approval for expanding memory space of my cloud pc. So that I can give my deliverable on time.
